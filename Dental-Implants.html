This technology was recently developed by Nobel Biocare and allows for collaboration between both the restorative doctor and the surgeon. This merging of knowledge and experience achieves not only increased safety, but also a more precise implant placement. In addition, the fabrication of a final prosthesis is completed prior to the surgery. The computer-guided implant surgery is done in an arthroscopic fashion without requiring any flap reflection. This benefits the patient in that there is less postoperative discomfort, less swelling and less bruising. Patients can often resume their normal activities the next day.The process starts when a CAT scan is taken of the patient’s jawbone. This CAT scan allows for the generation of a three-dimensional model of the jawbone that can then be used in virtual reality software to plan the implant placement without the presence of the patient. The results are more accurate dental implant placement, and less chair time for the patient at the surgery office.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d12082.70429544987!2d-73.943186!3d40.791135!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xf0a3939181d07cf4!2sBrisman+Implant+and+Oral+Surgery+New+York!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1530936127664" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><a href="https://rfrmain.blob.core.windows.net/dental-implants/Dental-Implants.html">dental implants</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
